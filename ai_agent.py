Analyze the following defect report and provide a structured response.

DEFECT REPORT:
{defect_description}

{historical_context}

TASK:
Analyze this defect report and respond with a JSON object containing:

1. **extracted_info**: Key information extracted from the report
   - equipment: What equipment/machine is affected
   - location: Where in the plant (line number, area, etc.)
   - issue: What is the specific problem
   - severity_signals: Keywords indicating severity (safety, halt, leak, etc.)

2. **category**: Classify into ONE of these categories:
   - Mechanical (physical parts, hydraulics, pneumatics, wear)
   - Electrical (wiring, circuits, sensors, power)
   - Quality Control (finish, dimensions, defects in product)
   - Safety (hazards, risks, PPE issues)
   - Process (procedures, workflow, configuration)

3. **priority**: Assign ONE priority level:
   - CRITICAL: Immediate safety risk OR complete production halt
   - HIGH: Significant quality impact OR multiple units affected
   - MEDIUM: Single unit affected, workaround exists
   - LOW: Minor/cosmetic issue, no production impact

4. **priority_reasoning**: Brief explanation of why this priority was assigned

5. **recommended_actions**: List of 3-5 specific action steps to resolve
   - Should be concrete and actionable
   - Include immediate actions and follow-up
   - If historical data shows similar defects, reference those solutions

6. **assigned_team**: Which team should handle this
   - Options: Maintenance, Quality Control, Safety, Production, Engineering

7. **estimated_resolution_time**: Realistic time estimate (e.g., "2 hours", "1 day", "3 days")
